///
///  - `omap_from_src`: A mapping from the original address space to the transformed address space

///    `PdbInternalRva::rva` performs this conversion in a safe manner.

///    space of the unoptimized binary. Use `PDB::omap_to_src` to obtain an instace of this OMAP.
///    Also, `Rva::original_rva` performs this conversion in a safe manner.
///
/// # Structure
///
/// OMAP tables are dense arrays, sequentially storing `OMAPRecord` structs sorted by source
/// address.
///
/// Each record applies to a range of addresses: i.e. record N indicates that addresses in the
/// half-open interval [ `record[n].source_address`, `record[n+1].source_address` ) were relocated
/// to a starting address of `record[n].target_address`. If `target_address` is zero, the `lookup()`
/// will return None, since this indicates a non-existent location in the target address space.
///
/// Given that the table is sorted, lookups by source address can be efficiently serviced using a
/// binary search directly against the underlying data without secondary data structures. This is
/// not the most cache efficient data structure (especially given that half of each cache line is
/// storing target addresses), but given that OMAP tables are an uncommon PDBs feature, the obvious
/// binary search implementation seems appropriate.

///
/// To obtain an instace of this address map, call `PDB::address_map`. It will determine the correct
/// translation mode and read all internal state from the PDB. Then use the conversion methods on
/// the address and offset types to translate addresses.
///
/// # Background
///
/// Addresses in PDBs are stored as offsets into sections of the PE file. The `AddressMap` contains
/// the PE's section headers to translate between the offsets and virtual addresses relative to the
/// image base (RVAs).
///
/// Additionally, Microsoft has been reordering the Windows system and application binaries to
/// optimize them for paging reduction, using a toolset reported to be derived from and/or built on
/// top of the [Vulcan research project]. Relatively little else is known about the tools or the
/// methods they use. Looking at Windows system binaries like `ntoskrnl.exe`, it is apparent that
/// their layout has been rearranged, and their respective symbol files contain _OMAP_ re-mapping
/// information. The [Microsoft Binary Technologies Projects] may be involved in this.
///
/// The internals of this transformation are not well understood. According to [1997 reference
/// material]:
///
/// > Yet another form of debug information is relatively new and undocumented, except for a few
/// > obscure references in `WINNT.H` and the Win32 SDK help. This type of information is known as
/// > OMAP. Apparently, as part of Microsoft's internal build procedure, small fragments of code in
/// > EXEs and DLLs are moved around to put the most commonly used code at the beginning of the code
/// > section. This presumably keeps the process memory working set as small as possible. However,
/// > when shifting around the blocks of code, the corresponding debug information isn't updated.
/// > Instead, OMAP information is created. It lets symbol table code translate between the original
/// > address in a symbol table and the modified address where the variable or line of code really
/// > exists in memory.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// To aid with translating addresses and offsets, this module exposes `AddressMap`, a helper that
/// contains all information to apply the correct translation of any kind of address or offset to
/// another. Due to the rearranging optimizations, there are four types involved:
///
///  - [`Rva`]: A _Relative Virtual Address_ in the actual binary. This address directly corresponds
///    to instruction pointers seen in stack traces and symbol addresses reported by debuggers.
///  - [`PdbInternalRva`]: An RVA as it would have appeared before the optimization. These RVAs are
///    used in some places and can be converted to an `Rva` in the actual address space.
///  - [`SectionOffset`]: An offset into a section of the actual binary. A `section` member of _n_
///    refers to section _n - 1_, which makes a section number of _0_ a null pointer.
///  - [`PdbInternalSectionOffset`]: An offset into a section of the original binary. These offsets
///    are used throughout the PDB and can be converted to either `SectionOffset`, or directly to
///    `Rva` in the actual address space.
///
/// For binaries that have not been optimized that way, the `PdbInternal*` values are effectively
/// equal to their regular counterparts and the conversion between the two are no-ops. Address
/// translation still has to assume different address spaces, which is why there is no direct
/// conversion without an `AddressMap`.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// # use pdb::{Rva, FallibleIterator};
/// #
/// # fn test() -> pdb::Result<()> {
/// # let source = std::fs::File::open("fixtures/self/foo.pdb")?;
/// let mut pdb = pdb::PDB::open(source)?;
///
/// // Compute the address map once and reuse it
/// let address_map = pdb.address_map()?;
///
/// # let symbol_table = pdb.global_symbols()?;
/// # let symbol = symbol_table.iter().next()?.unwrap();
/// # match symbol.parse() { Ok(pdb::SymbolData::Public(pubsym)) => {
/// // Obtain some section offset, eg from a symbol, and convert it
/// match pubsym.offset.to_rva(&address_map) {
///     Some(rva) => {
///         println!("symbol is at {}", rva);
/// #       assert_eq!(rva, Rva(26048));
///     }
///     None => {
///         println!("symbol refers to eliminated code");
/// #       panic!("symbol should exist");
